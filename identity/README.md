This directory contains images of the channel identity (five stripes colored according to the five teams of SNH48, with optional white text "SNH48" on top, one letter per stripe), and the script to generate the five stripes of any size.

These assets are tracked in this repository for the sake of record and transparency. Please do NOT use the identity without written permission from the owner, except when writing about or linking to the channel itself or related web identities (e.g., @snh48live on Twitter and @SNH48Live on GitHub).

A note on `tumblr-banner.png`: Tumblr's default header image size is 3000x1055 (at least for the Optica theme, the placeholder header of which you can check), and there's the option to "stretch heaader image" in the theme editor, which is perfect for our width-insensitive stripes. However, actually uploading a 3000x1055 image would lead to clipping of the outer stripes as the window gets narrower, since Tumblr will only do so much shrinking. Therefore, I ended up uploading a 750x1055 header which looks good in all cases.
